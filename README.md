# ROS-Mentorship-Program---RigBetel-Labs
During the ROS Mentorship program by RigBetel Labs, I developed a project showcasing a 2-wheel-drive robot navigating autonomously using ROS. The mentorship program covers basics of ROS, designing a robot and importing into Gazebo for simulation. The program also focuses on use of packages like SLAM and Navigation Stack for autonomous navigation.
